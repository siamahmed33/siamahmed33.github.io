<body>

<p>This paragraph is blue as it follows common property of p defined in practice.css. 
    It is colored by External CSS, it doesn't have any internal or inline CSS. 
</p>

<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">This is an inline CSS, it has the highest priority, but this color won't be in any other p.</p>

<p class="some_p">
    This is an example of internal CSS. Here class some_p is defined in style tag of this file. class has higher priority over commonly defined 
    CSS on an element.
</p>

<h2>
    This h2 is red if link is defined after style and blue otherwise. If same style is defined in different ways, then element 
    follows the last rule. 
</h2>

<h2 id="uniqueH2">An example of id, it has higher priority like class, so it won't follow common property. </h2>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com">This is an example of pseudo class. Check CSS code for understanding behavior.</a>

<h3>Another example of pseudo-class. It is not only appicable to links.</h3>
<div style="color:rosybrown;background-color: seagreen">
    <h2>h2 under a div</h2>
    <h3>h3 under a div</h3>
    <p>paragraph under a div, but it has a <span style="color:indigo;">span</span> inside it. </p>
    <p>
        Here color isn't effective, but bracground color is. Because color is already defined for elements, and it has higher priority over 
        styling definition of container. 
    </p>
</div>
